 * Static seed data standing in for the slip books — one book per firm, kept
 * apart exactly as the L.R. and bill books are. Replace with API calls when
 * the backend lands; everything downstream already asks for a firm's slips by
 * slug rather than importing a single register.
 *
 * The lorries and the routes are the ones each firm actually runs, so a slip
 * and the register behind it read as the same fleet. Nothing here is looked up
 * out of the L.R. book though — a loading slip goes out before there is a
 * bilty to look up, and often for a lorry that is never booked at all.
